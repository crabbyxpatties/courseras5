✨The `prefers-reduced-motion` media query 
is a feature in CSS that allows websites to adapt their UI and animations based 
on the user's preference for reduced motion. This is particularly useful for
 users who may experience discomfort or nausea when exposed to excessive motion
  effects on websites. Here's a comprehensive overview of the `prefers-reduced-motion`
   media query:

### 1. Syntax:
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: value) {
  /* CSS styles to apply when the prefers-reduced-motion condition is met */
}
```

### 2. Possible Values:
- `no-preference`: The user has not expressed a preference for reduced motion.
- `reduce`: The user prefers reduced motion. In this case, 
websites should minimize or eliminate non-essential motion effects.

### 3. Use Case:
The `prefers-reduced-motion` media query is commonly 
used to adjust or disable certain animations, transitions, 
or scroll effects on a website based on the user's motion preferences.

### 4. Example Usage:
```css
/* Apply styles when motion is not reduced */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  /* Styles for regular motion */
}

/* Apply styles when motion is reduced */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Styles for reduced motion */
}
```

### 5. Example Implementation:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Reduced Motion Example</title>
  <style>
    /* Regular animation */
    @keyframes bounce {
      0%, 20%, 50%, 80%, 100% {
        transform: translateY(0);
      }
      40% {
        transform: translateY(-30px);
      }
      60% {
        transform: translateY(-15px);
      }
    }

    /* Apply animation unless motion is reduced */
    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
      .box {
        animation: bounce 2s infinite;
      }
    }

    /* No animation when motion is reduced */
    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
      .box {
        animation: none;
      }
    }

    /* Other styles for the box */
    .box {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: coral;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="box"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the animation is applied by default, but it's disabled 
when the user prefers reduced motion.

### 6. Browser Support:
Most modern browsers support the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, 
including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

### 7. Considerations:
- Always strive to create accessible and inclusive designs.
- Test your website with reduced motion settings enabled to ensure a
 positive user experience for all.

Remember that browser features and standards may evolve, 
so it's a good practice to check the latest documentation for any updates.



/* Other styles for the box */
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: coral;

}


✨`prefers-color-scheme` media query is a CSS feature that allows websites to adapt
 their styles based on the user's preferred color scheme, whether it's light or
  dark mode. This is useful for providing a more comfortable reading experience 
  in different lighting conditions. Here's a comprehensive overview of the 
  `prefers-color-scheme` media query:

### 1. Syntax:
```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: value) {
  /* CSS styles to apply when the prefers-color-scheme condition is met */
}
```

### 2. Possible Values:
- `light`: The user prefers a light color scheme.
- `dark`: The user prefers a dark color scheme.
- `no-preference`: The user has not expressed a preference for light or dark mode.

### 3. Use Case:
The `prefers-color-scheme` media query is commonly used to adjust the color
 scheme of a website based on the user's preference, providing a visually appealing
  experience in both light and dark modes.

### 4. Example Usage:
```css
/* Apply styles for light mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* Light mode styles */
}

/* Apply styles for dark mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Dark mode styles */
}
```

### 5. Example Implementation:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Color Scheme Example</title>
  <style>
    /* Apply light mode styles by default */
    body {
      background-color: #ffffff;
      color: #000000;
    }

    /* Apply dark mode styles when prefers-color-scheme is dark */
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      body {
        background-color: #333333;
        color: #ffffff;
      }
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>This is a simple example of the prefers-color-scheme media query.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the background and text colors are adjusted based 
on the user's preferred color scheme.

### 6. Browser Support:
Most modern browsers support the `prefers-color-scheme` media query,
 including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

### 7. Considerations:
- Test your website in both light and dark mode to ensure a visually 
consistent and pleasant experience.
- Provide appropriate contrast in your color schemes for readability.

### 8. Browser Extensions:
Some browser extensions, like "Dark Reader," can override the system's
 color scheme, allowing you to test how your website looks in different modes.

### 9. Implementation in JavaScript:
You can also use JavaScript to dynamically update styles based 
on the user's color scheme preference.

```javascript
<script>
const prefersDarkMode = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;

if (prefersDarkMode) {
  // Apply dark mode styles
  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');
}
</script>
```

In this JavaScript example, a `dark-mode` class is added to the `body` 
element when the user prefers a dark color scheme.

Remember that browser features and standards may evolve, 
so it's a good practice to check the latest documentation for any updates.
